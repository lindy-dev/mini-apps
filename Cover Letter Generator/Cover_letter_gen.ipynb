      "The sky appears blue during the day due to a process called Rayleigh scattering. When sunlight enters the Earth's atmosphere, it encounters molecules and small particles in the air.\n",

As sunlight passes through the Earth's atmosphere, the blue light is scattered in many different directions by the gases and particles in the atmosphere much more effectively than the other colors.\n",
      "\n",
      "This scattering of blue light is what makes the sky appear blue during clear days when you look up. During sunrise and sunset, the sky often takes on a red or orange hue because as the sun gets lower in the sky, its light has to pass through more of Earth's atmosphere, causing shorter wavelengths (like blue and green) to scatter out even more and leaving longer wavelengths like red and orange.\n",
